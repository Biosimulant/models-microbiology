**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Robert Gnügge; Lekshmi Dharmarajan; Moritz Lang; Jörg Stelling

## Description

This model was used to describe the behaviour of the synthetic open loop circuit in yeast, published in [1]. The accompanying script will simulate the model as used in main Figure 2c. Additional scali
