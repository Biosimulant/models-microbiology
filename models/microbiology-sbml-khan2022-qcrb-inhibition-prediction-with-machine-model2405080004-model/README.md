# Khan2022 - QcrB Inhibition Prediction with Machine Learning Protocol

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2405080004)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Afreen A Khan; Sannidhi S Poojary; Ketki K Bhave; Santosh R Nandan; Krishna R Iyer

## Description

The cytochrome bcc complex (QcrB) is a subunit of the mycobacterial cyt-bcc-aa3 oxidoreductase, and it has been suggested as a good M.tb target due to the bacteria's dependence on oxidative phosphoryl
