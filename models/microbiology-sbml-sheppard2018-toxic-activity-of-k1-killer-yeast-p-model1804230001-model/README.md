# Sheppard2018 - Toxic Activity of K1 Killer Yeast Protein

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1804230001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Sean Sheppard; Duygu Dikicioglu

## Description

This is a deterministic model built using COPASI. It simulates the toxin activity of K1 toxin produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae from inoculation through to toxin-induced cell death of a population 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/microbiology-sbml-sheppard2018-toxic-activity-of-k1-killer-yeast-p-model1804230001-model/model.yaml
